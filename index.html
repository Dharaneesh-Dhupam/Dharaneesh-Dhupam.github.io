      A little bit about my academics: I studied Electronics and Communication Engineering
      at Indian Institute Of Information Technology, Kurnool (2020–2024)
      and also studied Economics, Sociology, and Public Administration (2022–2025).
    </p>

    <p class="mt-4 leading-relaxed">
      During college, I saw and understood how systems push people toward certain behaviors.
      One example is how a basic process like buying land can turn into a long, confusing, and sometimes unfair
      experience.
      That frustration, along with many other encounters with other systems and bureaucracies, led me to a question: can
      we
      build systems that people can actually trust? That
      question has been the thread through most of what I’ve built since then.

        The beginning of Systems Change
      </h3>

      <p class="mt-2 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
        Something I saw others struggling with years ago, but didn’t think much about at the time, kept coming back to
        me.
        Later, in my 3rd year of undergrad, I had to do a design project and I really wanted to build something I’d find
        meaningful
        and useful. Around that time, the cryptocurrency market had gone through a major boom and bust cycle.
        I had heard about blockchain a few years earlier and only knew its surface-level properties like immutability
        and
        decentralization. One thing I did know was that everyone in India struggles with the bureaucracy of buying or
        selling a
        home, which my own family had experienced. So I thought I could use blockchain to improve land records somehow.
        The idea evolved into something better. I eventually switched to a different architecture because blockchain was
        not suited
        for the job. I kept working on it through many iterations, I learnt a LOT in that process and after two years I
        finally decided to take it
        seriously and
        start a company.

        I started writing before college, mostly screenplays and short essays. I feel in love with writing.
        I guess it helps me understand myself better and helps me think clearly. It’s something I keep
        coming back to.
      <p class="pt-2">Until Now I have written 2 full length screenplays, the first in 2020, still haven't decided on a
        title for it.
        The 2nd one I completed in 2021, it's called <span class="italic">Chemicals</span>. Since then I have been
        working on another one titled
        <span class="italic">The World has gone Mad</span>.
      </p>
      <p class="pt-2">I am thinking of maybe writing it like a book but I don't know, if i can translate the visuals of
        the screenplayinto a book.
        I should probably write as a comicbook or something with the help of AI for image gen.</p>

          <h3 class="font-semibold text-md">Screenplay 1: <span class="italic">Untitled</span></h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700">Synopsis: A bank robbery goes wrong in the 1990s, with two protagonists trying to
            escape.</p>

      <p class="pt-2">I created <a href="https://seaofus.com" class="uk-link" target="_blank">SeaofUs.com</a>, to have a
        place to share my ideas and thoughts
        but till I don't think I have uploaded any of my good(in my opinion) stuff there, not sure why.
        Only blog I wrote with a bit of help from AI, is the one about <a
          href="https://seaofus.com/view_blog/xnBtR2ODXfTgKjZ/" class="uk-link">ETF's</a> and why
        they are against shareholder capitalism. Another original one is <a
          href="https://seaofus.com/view_blog/WZoGSqTArp2PCUM/" class="uk-link">My story</a>
        which is about my journey to buliding the site itself.
        All the other blogs are AI generated but with the topics i am interested in. I like using that site as a private
        space but not as a
        space to acutally share my original ideas.
        It's probably cause in my the user experience & UI when writing is really good but not when browsing the site
        itself.
        So that's probably the reason I don't want to put my work there.

      <p class="pt-2">
        I wrote the short essay a few years ago about the future of humanity and machines in a .txt file and i just
        named it 'future',
        i guess it's was my ideal/hopeful view of the future and the future I wanted to have / I predicted. I wrote this
        before chatgpt came out.
        But now even though I still agree with many of the things I wanted the future to have, as discussed in the
        essay. I don't
        think I have correctly evaluated the cost which we'll have to pay. So now I want to add another section called
        'Reflection'to discuss those things.
        Thought it'll be interesting to discuss. Please give it a read if you have the time 😊.
