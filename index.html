            I’m Dharaneesh Dhupam. I am currently the Founder & CEO of <span class="italic">Systems Change</span>.
            I love writing stuff that's has never been written before & watching really good movies. I enjoy learning
            and creating new things. I want to work on things which <span class="font-semibold">I find
              meaningful</span>.
            I want my work to actually improve people’s lives. Too cliché, I know. But that's what I genuinely want.

      A little bit about my academics: I studied Electronics and Communication Engineering
      at Indian Institute Of Information Technology, Kurnool (2020–2024)
      and also studied Economics, Sociology, and Public Administration (2022–2025).

      property transactions simple, verifiable, transparent, and tamper-proof.
    </p>

    <p class="mt-4 leading-relaxed">
      Over the years, I saw and understood how systems push people toward certain behaviors.
      One example is how a basic process like buying land can turn into a long, confusing, and sometimes unfair
      experience.
      That frustration, along with many other encounters with other systems and bureaucracies, led me to a question: can
      we
      build systems that people can actually trust and do what they are supposed to do? <a href="#systemschange"
        class="uk-link">Systems Change</a>
      is an attempt to answer that question.

    <p class="mt-4 leading-relaxed">
      Since I was kid, I have always been interested in technology, I used to follow the releseas of new phones & dream
      of building myself a PC & having a nice desk setup.
      I used to watch a lot of movies & series instead of going to school.
      After completing my 10th grade, I started thinking about what i really want to do and what kind
      of life I want to live.
      I was watching a Youtube video of Pewdiepie and he was talking about his start on Youtube & he said that he
      just wanted to share the fun he is having by playing games and that he really enjoyed the process of editing
      videos & uploading them.
      He said, he felt the same amount of 'happiness' for 100 subscribers as he did for a million. He didn't do it for
      fame or money. He did cause
      that's what he truly enjoyed.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-4 leading-relaxed">
      After that, I started thinking about what is something that I really enjoy doing? & What is something that I would
      do irrespective making money?
      Then I started exploring a lot of different things including economics, psychology, & one of the things I found
      out was that I really enjoy the
      process
      thinking, coming up with new ideas, & creating something new, so
      I started writing stories, which evolved into writing screenplays.
      Along the way, I also came across coding; it seemed interesting,
      so I gave it a try before starting my undergrad, and I learnt the basics and forgot about it. I really started to
      enjoy
      solving
      Python problem sets during my undergrad minor.
      In the process I also learned Django Framework & started building small projects with the help of
      <a href="https://cs50.harvard.edu/web/" class="uk-link">CS50 Web development course</a>.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-4 leading-relaxed mb-8">
      Basically, I want to work on things that I find interesting and meaningful, without the worry of economic
      constraints. I also believe that if we do what we truly love, success will naturally follow, and we don’t need to
      worry about chasing it.

        The beginning of Systems Change
      </h3>

      <p class="mt-2 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
        Something I saw others struggling with years ago, but didn’t think much about at the time, kept coming back to
        me.
        Later, in my 3rd year of undergrad, I had to do a design project and I really wanted to build something I’d find
        meaningful
        and useful. Around that time, the cryptocurrency market had gone through a major boom and bust cycle.
        I had heard about blockchain a few years earlier and only knew its surface-level properties like immutability
        and
        decentralization. One thing I did know was that everyone in India struggles with the bureaucracy of buying or
        selling a
        home, which my own family had experienced. So I thought I could use blockchain to improve land records somehow.
        The idea evolved into something better. I eventually switched to a different architecture because blockchain was
        not suited
        for the job. I kept working on it through many iterations, I learnt a LOT in that process and after two years I
        finally decided to take it
        seriously and
        start a company.

        I started writing before college, mostly screenplays and short essays. I feel in love with writing.
        I guess it helps me understand myself better and helps me think clearly. It’s something I keep
        coming back to.
      <p class="pt-2">Until Now I have written 2 full length screenplays, the first in 2020, still haven't decided on a
        title for it.
        The 2nd one I completed in 2021, it's called <span class="italic">Chemicals</span>. Since then I have been
        working on another one titled
        <span class="italic">The World has gone Mad</span>.
      </p>
      <p class="pt-2">I am thinking of maybe writing it like a book but I don't know, if i can translate the visuals of
        the screenplay into a book.
        I should probably write as a comicbook or something with the help of AI for image gen.</p>

        place to share my ideas and thoughts
        but till I don't think I have uploaded any of my good(in my opinion) stuff there, not sure why.
        Only blog I wrote with a bit of help from AI, is the one about <a
          href="https://seaofus.com/view_blog/xnBtR2ODXfTgKjZ/" class="uk-link">ETF's</a> and why

        which is about my journey to buliding the site itself.
        All the other blogs are AI generated but with the topics i am interested in. I like using that site as a private
        space but not as a
        space to acutally share my original ideas.
        It's probably cause in my the user experience & UI when writing is really good but not when browsing the site
        itself.
        So that's probably the reason I don't want to put my work there.

      <p class="pt-2">
        I wrote the short essay a few years ago about the future of humanity and machines in a .txt file and i just
        named it 'future',
        i guess it's was my ideal/hopeful view of the future and the future I wanted to have / I predicted. I wrote this
        before chatgpt came out.
        But now even though I still agree with many of the things I wanted the future to have, as discussed in the
        essay. I don't
        think I have correctly evaluated the cost which we'll have to pay and also my thinking has matured a lot. So now
        I've added another section called 'Reflection' to revist the essay & discuss the things I missed.
        Thought it'll be interesting to discuss. Please give it a read if you have the time 😊.
