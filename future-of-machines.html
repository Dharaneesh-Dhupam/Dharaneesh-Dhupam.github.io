            <img src="tfom.png" alt="Dystopian future with machines" class="w-full rounded-lg mb-8 shadow-md" />

            <p class="mb-4 leading-relaxed">
                If we look at the history of the world in the last 200 years or so, we can see that humans are making
                machines to get work
                done easier and cheaper. There is possibility that in the future that we will become slaves to machines,
                but I think the chances are very low of that happening in this particular way.
            </p>

            <p class="mb-4 leading-relaxed">
                Even if a super intelligent artificial intelligence was created, it will look at us like we do at ants,
                we don't make ants work, we just let them live and do what they want to do and maybe give it a sugar
                cube once in a while. We are already slaves to the machines, I don't know if the word 'slave' is correct
                for this context but we rely a lot on the machines. We rely on our smartphones to do everything from
                doing our work, watching movies, laughing by looking at jokes and etc. We rely on scanners like MRI and
                CT scan for our health and we rely of satellites and cables under the oceans for communication around
                the world. We depend on machines to travel.
            </p>

            <p class="mb-4 leading-relaxed">
                This picture shown is a glance into the dystopian world which our world can become. I think Machines
                will take our jobs and it's inevitable, it's just a matter of time. But that doesn't mean it's a bad
                thing, I think it's a good thing. If machines will do our work and we have a house, food and basic
                necessities taken care of by government or someone or something else. Then why should we work when a
                machine can do that for us?
            </p>

            <p class="mb-4 leading-relaxed">
                I think that's when we will start thinking about the meaning of life and ask questions like why are we
                here on this universe. I think if we'll have a lot of time, we will start to look inside ourselves
                and understand what we really care about. I actually look forward to Artificial intelligence taking over
                the world, I think it will actually help us and it's probably better than many of the governments.
            </p>

            <p class="mb-4 leading-relaxed">
                I also think that chances of that happening are low compared to the chances that humans will combine
                their intelligence with computers and achieve the same power equivalent to a super intelligent
                artificial
                intelligence. I think our brain will get the processing power of our brain combined with the power of
                super computer or a quantum computer and when that happens there will be no more diseases no more death
                and only exploring the universe and understanding it and maybe we will go beyond our universe or we will
                start playing a game as real as our life where we can get whatever we want and we will probably get
                bored by getting whatever we want and finally we'll start playing a game where we don't know that we are
                in a game,which will be as real as our life. Maybe we are already in game and we just don't know it. I
                think this
                will happen soon, at least I hope so.

                    I wrote this 4.5 years ago, I largely still believe that the best outcome is having a super
                    intelligent artificial intelligence which will take over the world and help improve our conditions
                    which
                    was supposed to be the jobs of the 'Governments'. I also believe that merging with AI itself is best
                    way
                    to make them aligned, but
                    I don't think this merging is the ideal case for many of the people. There is a high probability
                    that
                    Merging with AI will lead to a
                    something similar to what happened with our relationship with smartphones. Most of the people who
                    use
                    smartphones has a unhealthy relationship with it.
                    The apps which exploit the nature of the brain are the norm. What's the point of having unlimited
                    knowledge at our fingertips
                    if we can't use it to better the our human condition and live a fulfilling/meanningful life?
                    The goals intended for the things & the systems we create are not always aligned with how it plays
                    out in the real world.
                </p>
                <p class="py-4">
                    I stopped using a smartphone about 2 months ago and I feel so much better, but what about the 'real
                    benfits' a phone
                    actually provides? Like making calls, sending messages. I listed them as real benefits cause these
                    are I
                    believe these are
                    the things which are not designed to consume/indulge oursleves in. They actually improve our lives.
                    Another real benefit in my opinion is the convienice of payment. in India most people transitioned
                    from cash to <a href="https://www.npci.org.in/product/upi" class="text-blue-600">UPI</a>, it's a
                    simple payment
                    system (A payment gateway interface) which is used transfer money between people & merchants. All
                    you need to do is open the app scan the QR code of the merchant/person or enter their mobile number
                    which is linked to the other person bank account,
                    and just enter the amount you want to transfer & your 4 digit pin and you're good to go. UPI
                    processed <a href="https://www.npci.org.in/product/upi/product-statistics"
                        class="text-blue-600">20.47 billion transactions</a> in a single month in October 2025. So
                    basically having this ability
                    to transact became a necesssary/essential part of my life.

                </p>

                <p class="py-4">
                    Yet, I realized my relationship with my phone was unhealthy. So i decided to start using a Feature
                    phone called <a href="https://www.hmd.com/en_in/hmd-101-4g-dual-sim?sku=SP01Z07Z2343Y"
                        class="text-blue-600">HMD 101</a>. But I was still going back & forth between my feature phone &
                    my smartphone, like it was
                    some kind of drug i am addicted to do & also it was too just much comfort too lose. So anyway i
                    started reducing the time i spend on my smartphone
                    slowly. Also I realized when I went back using my smartphone I felt more anxious & restless, which I
                    haven't observed before. Maybe cause it was my normal/default state.
                    I'll give you another example, the internet &
                    world-wide web were supposed to something which is supposed connect and share things freely across
                    the globe,
                    but what happened? I can't even run a server on my laptop & host a website to the 'public internet',
                    because I don't have a public static IP address, because the internet providers doesn't provide
                    them.
                    So i can't share my work to the world. So now I have to go to a cloud provider to get a public IP to
                    hosy my site and pay them money even though I have the hardware (my old laptop) to run a 24 hour
                    server. Or I have to jump through many hoops to setup Port forwarding on my router to forward the
                    incoming traffic to my laptop.

                </p>

                <p class="py-4">
                    At first I thought, maybe this whole networking thing is kind of too complicated and maybe cause we
                    are running out of IPv4, it's not feasible
                    for the ISPs (Internet Service Providers) to allot me a public IP. Then I was messing around with
                    TOR in my first year of college. Do you know what I discovered?
                    I can start hosting a public server with a public IP address in the so called 'DarkNet' in like 2
                    minutes, I just had to add one line to the config file.
                    The area of the internet which was supposed to be Dark has more freedom for the individual than the
                    "Open Internet", that's the irony.
                    Now the internet is firewalled by the big companies like AWS, Google & Cloudfare. If these companies
                    go
                    down the internet goes down with them. The supposed interconnectivity of nodes became an illusion.
                </p>

                <p class="py-4">
                    The same thing is happening with "Blockchains", most of the nodes in the blockchain network are run
                    by a few big entities. These are not organic users,
                    Most of these nodes just servers in data centers rather than actual users. Yet, we say blockchains
                    are decentralized. No, it's not.
                    Ok i think i am going off track here. Let's get back to AI, basically what i am saying if we merge
                    with AI, it'll probably feel like taking all the meth in the world
                    at once. We won't know about the effects it'll have on our ourselves & society. In my opinion
                    merging with AI is equivalent to becoming a kind of God. But i think it's a
                    required thing to achieve so that we can actually have a good government (optimistically). SO we
                    only need a few/subset of humans
                    to merge with AI to create a better world for the rest of us. Maybe only just 1 person needs to
                    merge.
                </p>

                <p class="py-4">
                    I also think we haven't explored ourselves fully. I think we don't need to invent new things to make
                    our lives better. I think we alreeady have enough and
                    in my opinion, we can be forever at peace & happy if we just meditate. So i am linking this <a
                        href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U08aXyQifW8" class="text-blue-600"> Live stream
                        Recording</a> from Harvard trained psychiatrist Dr. Alok, also please check out his channel <a
                        href="https://www.youtube.com/@HealthyGamerGG" class="text-blue-600">HealthyGamerGG</a>, I think
                    it's gold mine.
                    I think all the answers are there, we just need to find them. I know that I am getting philosophical
                    & pseduo-sciency, but I think it's important to explore these things with an open mind and find out
                    if they are actually true or not. So we don't need to look to the starts for the answers , we just
                    need to look inside ourselves. (in my opinion)
                </p>
                <p class="py-4">
                    So in my opinion merging with AI may have will make us wayyyy more powerful yet less free. It's a
                    tricky thing we need to choose/balance.
                    I'd prefer if most of the humanity doesn't go the merging route, but I think they will. Similarr to
                    the how we use phones which we are addicted to.
                    Similar to how instead of us controlling our phones, they control and shape our lives. That's one of
                    the threats of merging.
                </p>
                <p class="py-4">
                    I don't know how to end this, I know my writing is all over the place but basically what i am saying
                    is don't give monkey a button which
                    will detonate a nuclear warhead.
                    But the problem is we already did that. We have nuclear & AI.
                    I hope we are more than a monkey. (No offence to monkeys)
