            <p class="mb-4 leading-relaxed">
                If we look at the history of the world in the last 200 years or so, we can see that humans are making
                machines to get work
                done easier and cheaper. There is possibility that in the future that we will become slaves to machines,
                but I think the chances are very low of that happening in this particular way.
            </p>

            <p class="mb-4 leading-relaxed">
                Even if a super intelligent artificial intelligence was created, it will look at us like we do at ants,
                we don't make ants work, we just let them live and do what they want to do and maybe give it a sugar
                cube once in a while. We are already slaves to the machines, I don't know if the word 'slave' is correct
                for this context but we rely a lot on the machines. We rely on our smartphones to do everything from
                doing our work, watching movies, laughing by looking at jokes and etc. We rely on scanners like MRI and
                CT scan for our health and we rely of satellites and cables under the oceans for communication around
                the world. We depend on machines to travel.
            </p>

            <p class="mb-4 leading-relaxed">
                This picture shown is a glance into the dystopian world which our world can become. I think Machines
                will take our jobs and it's inevitable, it's just a matter of time. But that doesn't mean it's a bad
                thing, I think it's a good thing. If machines will do our work and we have a house, food and basic
                necessities taken care of by government or someone or something else. Then why should we work when a
                machine can do that for us?
            </p>

            <p class="mb-4 leading-relaxed">
                I think that's when we will start thinking about the meaning of life and ask questions like why are we
                here on this universe. I think if we'll have a lot of time, we will start to look inside ourselves
                and understand what we really care about. I actually look forward to Artificial intelligence taking over
                the world, I think it will actually help us and it's probably better than many of the governments.
            </p>

            <p class="mb-4 leading-relaxed">
                I also think that chances of that happening are low compared to the chances that humans will combine
                their intelligence with computers and achieve the same power equivalent to a super intelligent
                artificial
                intelligence. I think our brain will get the processing power of our brain combined with the power of
                super computer or a quantum computer and when that happens there will be no more diseases no more death
                and only exploring the universe and understanding it and maybe we will go beyond our universe or we will
                start playing a game as real as our life where we can get whatever we want and we will probably get
                bored by getting whatever we want and finally we'll start playing a game where we don't know that we are
                in a game,which will be as real as our life. Maybe we are already in game and we just don't know it. I
                think this
                will happen soon, at least I hope so.
